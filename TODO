TODO:  List of the things left to do, in no particular order

HAVE TO GET DONE FOR V1:

1. See if there's a better way to handle someone going to paypal and then back to the site without doing anything. An order
is created, and the user can see it in "My Account", but should it be visible yet? Or should it just say something
relating to not having heard back from paypal about the transaction yet? Maybe that's the way, if the order_status is nil,
paypal hasn't talked to us yet, and we can say that we haven't heard back from paypal yet.

2. Try to move logic out of store/products and the product_list partial and into the controller/models.

3. Move assets to S3 and serve using asset_sync gem.

4. Set up asset caching/expiry



GETTING READY FOR PROD #######################################################

1. Make sure all prod env vars are set up on Heroku. Currently a few behind staging.

2. Paypal!
    a. Set up paypal account for BCD. (temporarily using one just for dev.)
    b. Set it to redirect to the correct thank you page.
    c. Be sure I'm parsing paypal IPNs correctly.

3. Set up a cname for my S3 instruction and assets buckets. Already have one set up for prod for images in cloudfront.
    See that for an example.

4. Set up SSL on heroku. Buy SSL cert first https://addons.heroku.com/SSL

5. Set up a database through heroku.

6. Need to figure out what I did with GK so that the app doesnt keep getting unloaded in heroku.

7. Set up cron job via scheduler add-on to weekly send sitemap to google. Make sure google accepts the sitemap. It may
    not work properly to submit the sitemap from the s3 url until the https prod version is set up, because all the urls
    in the sitemap are for https://www.brickcitydepot.com  Heroku's scheduler doesn't have options for weekly or monthly,
    but I can fake it by wrapping the call to the rake task in a bash if statement:
    if [ "$(date +%u)" = 1 ]; then MY_COMMAND; fi       where 1 is mondays
    if [ "$(date +%d)" = 01 ]; then MY_COMMAND; fi      where 01 is the first day of the month

###########################
THINGS I NEED TO DO FOR LAUNCH:

1. Migrate db and reseed with latest data, making sure to remove image, fake user and fake order data
2. Set up maintenance rake tasks(reap stale carts, etc.)
3. Test paypal in sandbox mode in beta environment, and then test paypal in production mode, before switching to using
sales@brickcitydepot.com.
4. Test that emails can be sent out. In order to get this to work, I'll probably have to add mx records to dnsimple. See
how I did it for GK.
5. Make sure I can upload images to S3
6. Make sure I can upload/download pdfs to/from S3
7. Set up some sort of database backup task.
8. Need to make sure I have a working logger.
9. There must always be at least 1 free set of instructions.

##########################

##########################
IMMEDIATELY AFTER LAUNCH:

1. Make sure emails to sales@ and service@brickcitydepot.com are going through. Re-test this every couple of days for
   a couple of weeks.
2. Do a test transaction with just instructions, and one with just a physical item, and one with both.
3. Make sure I can create an account and login with FB and Twitter.
4. Make sure I can upload/download pdfs

##########################

##############################################################################

########################################################################################################################

V1.1: (Revisit this after 1.0 gets launched.)

1. Make it so that the product_details action renders a page that says "We can't find that item, check out these other great items."
instead of rendering a 404 if we can't find the item.

2. Some way of creating discounts for a product, or multiple products, or for an entire category/subcategory

3. Have a way for customers to rate a product and leave comments about it.

4. Add expires_in shtuff to pages that don't have user-specific info, or things that don't change much. Examples would be /,
   the product details pages, FAQ, contact, etc. This can avoid trips to the database for stuff that doesn't change often.
   Can check this out here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-caching-ruby-rails

5. I might want a way to sweep addresses out of the database after an order has been completed for 60 days. That minimizes
   a users info in our database.

6. Set up something for the instructions products model that keeps track of the version of the instructions, or at least
   the parts lists. That way, I can add something to the html parts list that does a check of BCD.com when loading, looking for the latest
   version of the parts list. Send the version number to BCD, and if there's a newer version of the parts list, return the new
   version number, and the updates. (Replaced so and so brick with so and so) so that the user can decide if they want to
   upgrade or not. This will require setting up a new model for Updates related to instructions/parts lists

7. Look into adding other countries for shipping, and see what that entails, what fields I might have to add/change.
   Make sure I'm in synch with what paypal returns.

8. Work on an auto-logout for timed out sessions. Through devise, I have a mechanism to expire sessions, but the site doesn't
actually redirect users to the home page, so it's not obvious they've timed out until their next request. Is this necessary,
or just nice to have?

9. For the sake of smoothness, it might make sense to have TOS be its own page. That way, a guest can enter their email,
    and I don't have to give the impression that they need to check the TOS box again. Just a thought.

10. Maybe make a fun maintenance page, or image for maintenance mode.

11. I just added the protected_attributes gem for trying to get on rails 4 quickly. Work on removing that by removing
attr_accessible and setting up strong params. After I've done this, try to remove this line from
config/initializers/session_store.rb: ActiveRecord::SessionStore::Session.attr_accessible :data, :session_id

12. Had to comment out brakeman in Gemfile. Try adding it back periodically to see if it will play nice with the version
of tilt I have installed

13. Fill out details for the Lego neighborhood extras page.

14. store/products page, work on the condition that checks if product_type name is Instructions. Eventually work on
making that check if the category has subcategories, and if so, display subcategories. If there are categories,
display categories.

15. I really need to spend some time cleaning and DRYing up my tests.

16. Look into pros/cons of moving from thin to unicorn on heroku

17. Work on adding titles to most of the customer facing pages. Also, I might want to do a little more customization
   on the facebook meta tags to reflect the current page. Maybe the product pages could have the image be the medium image.
   The description could be the product description, etc. If I'm going to do that, I'm going to need to feed that data in
   on a per page basis via some helper. I think I may have to do one or more content_for-style helpers, feed them args
   and if those args are populated, use the values, else use a default. Similar to the way I set up the title in the
   application layout.

18. Think about adding a Bricklink Seller model. This could be the basis of a preferred BL seller for a given model. Say
    I arranged deals with various BL sellers to try and keep in stock the pieces needed to make a model. Then I could
    create a BL Seller, and have a join table with a BL seller ID and product ID  to tie preferred BL sellers to a given
    model.

19. Work through code and apply the law of demeter to where I've chained methods for object attributes. This ought to
    help me clean up testing code also.

20. I need a public page for 503s, like I have 404s, 422s and 500s

21. Update Users Download Counts admin tool could use a nice search feature instead of the huge dropdown.

22. Figure out how to add a feature to allow a user to get an email about a product when it's back in stock.

23. Add a main flag for image model. Going forward, I can grab the image flagged main for a given product instead of
just the first image uploaded.

24. Change font color or style for Admin placeholders to set them apart a bit from entered text. The gray and
black aren't distinct enough from each other.

########################################################################################################################
V1.2 AND BEYOND:

1. Work on caching, starting with the most visited pages. Look into adding some caching using memcached

2. Limit access to admin urls by IP

3. Break products into their respective subcategories for display in the store.

4. I don't like the jquery alert popup I picked and I want to change it.

5. More Email Stuff!
    a. Set up a promotion email style
    b. Set up a new model email style. Maybe this can be roughly the same as the promotion email, which can also be used
    for discounts, etc.

6. Add some functionality for cancelling admins accounts

7. Extend reporting on advertising campaigns. Right now I just have a total user count for an advertising campaign.
Maybe I could just have something that spit out a csv with all users created_at dates for a given campaign, and then we can
import that data into some graphing something-or-other offline.

8. For errors I don't know I need to rescue, I set up exception_notification. I might want to set up exception_logger
    like I had for the reportal. https://github.com/undees/jchunky-exception_logger I think I'll see how exception_notification
    does first and if I feel I need to be logging to the database also, then I can maybe set up exception_logger also.

9. Make it so ALL of my styled buttons give some indication they've been hovered over and clicked

10. I might want to re-do the 422 and 500 pages a little bit. They seem... meh. Maybe freshen up the 404 page too.

11. For full-site maintenance mode, I'm currently using the stock Heroku mm page. I'd like to set up a custom mm page
at public/maintenance_mode.html

12. Content slider on main page:
     a.) Need to set up to position text and image. Image can have no position, peg to the top or bottom, left or right. Then I
     need to be able to do the same thing for text.

13. Go through controllers and rescue potential 404s the same way I did in the store/product_details action.

14. Spending tiers will earn coupon codes worth $. $50, $100, $200 and $300 will get $5, $10, $20 and $30 coupon codes.

15. Make cart remove/update functionality ajax-y

16. Have an order fulfillment screen for physical orders in admin area where we can change status of orders. If an item
stays in a non-shipped status for a couple of days, send a reminder email to let us know to deal with it. (Update May 2014. The order fulfillment
screen is done, but I don't yet have the reminder email set up.)

17. Think more about how I handle order confirmation emails, and decrementing inventories. It might make sense
    to handle both with background tasks that run after getting notification back from paypal. Right now I'm sending out the order
    confirmation email and decrementing inventory when I get a IPN back from Paypal. I think this can be something I do a little later.
    Sales are not heavy enough to warrant doing this right now.

18. Be able to 'gift' instructions. This tool will allow us to give a user free instructions, for whatever reason. There should be 2
forms on the page. The first will allow us to look up a user by email, and then display the items they've already purchased from us.
The 2nd form should only be displayed after the first one has been used, and will include a hidden field with the users email address
in it. It will also list out every model we have instructions for and have a checkbox next to each for easily selecting multiple
instructions. There can also be a 'select all' checkbox that will select all the instructions for gifting. This can come in handy when
the time comes to start getting the site translated, and then I can offer to give the translators all the instructions for free. Maybe
that doesn't make sense. For those users, it might make more sense if there was a tool that allowed us to just give a user access to
all instructions, always. We would want a tool like that for Brian and I and anybody else that helps us out greatly anyways. So then,
the gifting tool really just needs a combobox to allow us to gift a user 1 set of instructions.

19. Set up a way to create codes that we can send to buyers from Ebay. Then, as part of the checkout process on ebay, we can send them a
link to BCD, along with a code that allows them to download from us. This will give us more control over the process, end
our relationship with yousendit, force the user to learn about our website (which will hopefully lead to future purchases on our website instead of ebay).
This will entail either an API that can be called via an ebay checkout process, or for Brian to use a tool I set up that generates a
link with a guid that can be sent to the user. The guid will essentially be a unique identifier that will link a user (presumably with no email)
to the downloads they purchased. (Update - May 2014. I have this set up, but in order to use it via ebay, I'll have to work on setting up a
custom ebay checkout.)

20. Enhance the basic order reporting. I don't really like the way I did it.

21. Add a friends page, where we link to Crowkillers, Dustin Crops, our Authorized Resellers, etc.

22. See if it's possible to integrate with Rebrickable. They have an API at rebrickable.com/api that I could maybe use to get a users sets,
and then with those sets inventories, I could perhaps figure out how many of the pieces necessary to build one of our models a
user already had. Then I could present them with that information: "You already have 85% of the parts necessary to build this model", or
something like that. That would have to be on-demand sort of feature, that would shuffle a task into the background, and then
present the information after some processing. This would probably be a really expensive operation, and it might not be worth it,
but may be fun to try. This could possibly work using the get_set_match API, if we could pay him to upload our models as sets.

23. Figure out some way to have codes that can be redeemed for x numbers of dollars.

24. Admin products page could benefit from a live search feature.

25. Figure out how to accommodate Lisa's letters. This would be the first product with options. Options for this particular
product would include the letter of the alphabet and a style. On the admin side, I could have a product_options table, with
fields for product_id, name, description. When a user buys a product with an option, create a item_options record. This table
would have item_id, and a number of optionx fields. Maybe 3-4 fields, so: option1, option2, etc. Make sure to include option
information in the emails, what I send to paypal (just for display purposes), and to the order fulfillment junk on the back
end. Probably the easiest way to do this would just be a static page.

26. Craft (built-to-order) products should have an interest form on their product pages. The interest form could have dropdowns for
options specifically for that product. After the user has filled out the form, they can then submit the form, and it
will come to us in the form of email. In order to have the dropdowns with the options in the option families, I'll need to
implement something similar to what I was thinking of in the previous item. Probably ought to just do a static page.

27. Add a task that looks for users who haven't logged in for 3 months or so and send them a "come on back" email. The
email would include products that had launched since the last time the user had logged in. This shouldn't run but once a
month or so, and when the email is sent, it should update a timestamp for the user so I know not to send the user the same
email a month later. Think about this some more...

28. See about getting our domain added to some non-junk whitelists if our emails showing up in spam folders becomes a problem:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/294894/are-there-white-lists-for-yahoo-gmail-hotmail-and-aol

########################################################################################################################
NICE TO HAVE EVENTUALLY:

1. Reward users for passing the word on. If they tweet/FB/stumbleupon, digg,
or whatever, then unlock a special set of instructions. They will be able to
download that set of instructions, for free. Might want there to only be one
set of instructions they can download, or maybe let them choose from 3 or 4,
and give them ways to unlock the rest. 2 ways to handle this. Either the user
gets credited automatically, if he is logged in. Or, something gets stored in
the session and something gets posted to flash for every page that user visits
until they login/sign up. When they sign in/ sign up, will need to check to
make sure they haven't previously unlocked instructions.

2. Something fun to try would be "team buying", where users
can recommend a set of instructions to a friend, and if x number of friends
buy using the recommenders recommendation, then the recommender gets free
instructions. Maybe instead of team buying, I can set it up so that every time
a user buys a set of instructions, they get 2 coupon codes that they can give
to friends to use. The coupon codes are good for maybe 25% off a set of instructions
and if the coupon code gets used, then the person who shared the code also gets
25% off a set of instructions.

3. Try to decouple external resources as much as possible, so that I can
quickly switch providers if Amazon or Paypal get too expensive.

4. Might want to look into customizing PDFs using PDFKit, Railscast 220.

5. Right now, behavior is such that when users go to checkout, I won't let
them buy instructions they've bought before. Might want to change this to
allowing them to do so, but they're just buying more downloads at a discounted
rate.

6. i18n and l10n

7. Add a refund form on the individual orders page in the admin console. In order to do refunds right, I would probably
have to dip in to paypals api and have some sort of little refund button right on the order
details page. This button would kill the users link to the instructions, refund them and set the download records remaining = 0.
