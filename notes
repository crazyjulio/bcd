Had been doing this to save parts images to S3, but it wasn't compatible with
what I was doing with Carrierwave
# s3 = Aws::S3::Resource.new(region: 'us-east-1')
# bucket = ENV['BCD_S3_IMAGE_BUCKET']
# s3_file = "parts_images/#{color_id}/#{guid}#{extension}"
# obj = s3.bucket(bucket).object(s3_file)
# truth = obj.upload_file(file)
# if truth
#   self.image = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/#{bucket}/#{s3_file}"
# end
