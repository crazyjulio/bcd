  The LEGO Neighborhood Book is your guide to creating incredible LEGO buildings. Snap together a few apartments, shops,
  houses, and soon you'll have a whole neighborhood! Inside these pages, you'll learn techniques for recreating classic
  architectural styles in LEGO bricks, like San Francisco's famous Victorians and New York City's brownstones. LEGO
  model-building experts Brian and Jason Lyles will teach you how to create interesting architectural features like cornices
  and false fronts, and how to construct porches and detailed interiors. With full color instructions for three multistory
  houses and many smaller builds (like a reclining armchair and an old-timey lamppost), The LEGO Neighborhood Book will
  give you hours of building fun. What will your neighborhood look like?

    We've included some companion files on this page to assist you in building the models in the book. Each of the
    larger models has 2 parts lists available to you, a checklist style list that opens up in your browser and
    a XML file that you can use to upload the complete parts list to Bricklink's wanted list feature. If you're not
    familiar with how that works, or Bricklink, check out the #{link_to 'BCD Tutorial', new_user_tutorial_path} and
    the #{link_to 'BrickLink Tutorial', "http://www.bricklink.com/help.asp?topicID=35"} We've also included a PDF with
    instructions on how to build a delivery truck that fits into the Corner Drug Stores delivery bay. Parts lists for
    the truck are also included. Enjoy!
