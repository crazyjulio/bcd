%p This page should probably just be a subset of the users account page, where they can see if they have FB/Twitter or not, and can add/destroy auths, but there shouldn't be sign in/sign up links, and there should definitely be some way to keep a user from deleting his last auth without warning the user, or at least forcing him to enter a password and confirmation to set the account up as a normal account, if he hasn't already done so. If the user has an account with a password, then they can delete their last auth.
