    A quick note about how this form works.
  </b>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  If you want a report for a single month, make sure the same month is selected for both the start and end month. If you ran the report before the month was completed, and you want to run it again for a more up to date report, click the "Force
  Regeneration" button. If you want to run a report for multiple months, you need to first run the single month reports. For example, if you want to see complete sales reports from January to March, first run the single month reports for January,
  February and March individually. Then you can see the sales numbers for all 3 months. The "Force Regeneration" button is not used for multi-month reports.
