      What we do for those with accounts:
    %br
    %b
      1.
    Give you free instructions.
    %br
    %b
      2.
    Keep you informed of sales, new models, etc. Update you when we've had to make changes to the PDF or parts
    lists for a set of instructions you bought. (If you want us to, you can always opt out.)
    %br
    %b
      3.
    Download your instructions any time. You won't need to keep track of an order confirmation email we send you
    with a download link. Computer crashed? Lost the files? No problem. Just sign in and go to the 'My Account' page and
    download from there.

      What we don't do for those with accounts:
    %br
    %b
      1.
    Sell your information (We wouldn't do that to guests either.)
    %br
    %b
      2.
    Email you if you don't want us to. The exception would be emails relating specifically to your orders.

      You can still check out as a guest.
